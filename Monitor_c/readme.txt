AMain.c is a test main file for the system. The audio system fo the latest ubuntu kernel is based on alsa instead of OSS. So I simply read the voice data from the txt files for analysis. For audio data extraction of alsa, http://blog.csdn.net/ruancsdn/article/details/135911.


This C version codes are totally written according to the matlab codes, so I didn't write any annotation for them. If you've any question, please refer to the original matlab codes, or contact me via email. Because of the limited time, the C code haven't been much optimized on time&space consumption. If you optimize the codes or write it into hardware in the future, I'll appreciate you for sending me the final version. Thanks a lot. :D
